\chapter{DISCUSSION}
This suggests that verbs play a more critical role in aligning textual descriptions to visual features.
Adjective masking results in a moderate performance drop, while other POS types (not shown here) follow similar trends.
These findings reinforce the hypothesis that different parts of speech contribute unequally to cross-modal representation learning, with verbs carrying more alignment-critical information than nouns in this context.
