\chapter{DISCUSSION}
This suggests that verbs play a more critical role in aligning textual descriptions to visual features.
Adjective masking results in a moderate performance drop, while other POS types (not shown here) follow similar trends.
These findings reinforce the hypothesis that different parts of speech contribute unequally to cross-modal representation learning, with verbs carrying more alignment-critical information than nouns in this context.
The ranking of each \acrshort{pos} masking method aligns with the \acrshort{itm} and \acrshort{itc} loss curves, where a lower loss corresponds to higher retrieval accuracy.
This indicates that the retrieval performance on the Flickr30K dataset is more strongly influenced by the \acrshort{itm} and \acrshort{itc} losses than by the \acrshort{mlm} loss.
